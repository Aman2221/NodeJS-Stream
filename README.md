# Node.js 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it efficient for scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven model and comes with npm, a package manager for easy library integration. It is widely used for building server-side applications, APIs, and real-time applications.

# Node.js streams
Node.js streams are a feature that allows efficient processing of data in chunks, rather than loading entire datasets into memory. They come in four types: Readable for input, Writable for output, Duplex for bidirectional flow, and Transform for data manipulation during transfer. Streams are particularly useful for handling large files or real-time data, improving performance and reducing memory usage in Node.js applications.
