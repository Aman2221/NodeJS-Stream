# Node.js 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it efficient for scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven model and comes with npm, a package manager for easy library integration. It is widely used for building server-side applications, APIs, and real-time applications.
